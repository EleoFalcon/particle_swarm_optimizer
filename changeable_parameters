The parameters that can be changed in the particle swarm optimizer to optimize the performance of the algorithm:
- entropy
- num_particles
- local_radius
- velocity coefficient
- starting randomness sigma
- exit criterion
- Does velocity depend on difference in scores
- Behavior for particles that would cross boundaries

Parameters that are inherent to the problem being solved and cannot be changed:
- limits
- function
